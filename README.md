## Deployment Configuration

### Development Mode (Local Deployment)

For development with live reload and debugging capabilities:

```bash
meteor npm run start-dev
```

**What this command does:**
- Creates a secure tunnel using the **Magic Box** tool
- Prompts for **YubiKey** authentication to generate a secure proxy URL
- Provides a publicly accessible URL for mobile device testing
- Enables live reload and debugging features
- Eliminates the need for manual port forwarding

### Production Mode

For production deployment:

```bash
meteor npm run start
```

**Production considerations:**
- Starts the Meteor server in production mode
- Server must be accessible via your production domain or IP address
- No tunneling or proxy setup required
- Optimized for performance and security

## Firebase Configuration

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is essential for push notification functionality. Follow these steps to configure Firebase for your application.

### Initial Firebase Setup

1. **Create Firebase Project**
   - Navigate to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Note your project ID for later configuration

2. **Enable Cloud Messaging**
   - In your Firebase project, navigate to the Cloud Messaging section
   - Enable the Cloud Messaging API
   - Configure your messaging settings as needed

3. **Create Platform Applications**
   - Create both Android and iOS applications within your Firebase project
   - Follow the setup wizard for each platform
   - Download the required configuration files

### Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android Configuration

Download the `google-services.json` configuration file and place it in the correct directory structure.

<div align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/googleservice.png" alt="Android Firebase Configuration Screen" width="700" />
  <p><em>Firebase Console - Android app configuration and file download</em></p>
</div>

**File placement:** The `google-services.json` file should be placed in `public/android/google-services.json`

#### iOS Configuration

Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` configuration file for iOS integration.

<div align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/plist.png" alt="iOS Firebase Configuration Screen" width="700" />
  <p><em>Firebase Console - iOS app configuration and file download</em></p>
</div>

**File placement:** The `GoogleService-Info.plist` file should be placed in `public/ios/GoogleService-Info.plist`

### Security Considerations

> **Important Security Notice**
> 
> Never download or manually handle the Firebase Admin SDK JSON file. Instead, use the Firebase Admin SDK secret string method for secure environment variable configuration.

### Configuration Files Summary

| Platform | Configuration File | Destination Path |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Android | `google-services.json` | `public/android/google-services.json` |
| iOS | `GoogleService-Info.plist` | `public/ios/GoogleService-Info.plist` |

**Note:** The `mobile-config.js` file automatically handles the inclusion of these configuration files in your Cordova build process.

### Firebase Admin SDK Configuration

#### Obtaining the Admin SDK Secret

1. Access your Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Project Settings â†’ Service Accounts
3. Generate a new private key
4. Copy the JSON content (this is your admin SDK secret)

#### Environment Variable Setup

**For production servers:**
```bash
export FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON='{"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id","private_key_id":"...","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n..."}'
```

**For development environment:**
- Create a file: `server/private/firebase-admin-key.json`
- Add the JSON content to this file
- Ensure this file is included in your `.gitignore`
- Update the reference in your `firebase.js` configuration file

**Important:** Always use environment variables for production deployments to maintain security.

## Mobile Application Development

### Android Development

#### Initial Setup
```bash
meteor add-platform android
meteor add cordova:@havesource/cordova-plugin-push@5.0.5
```

#### Running on Physical Android Device
Ensure your Android device is connected via USB with Developer Options and USB Debugging enabled.

```bash
meteor npm run start android-device --mobile-server=https://<your-proxy-url-or-production-domain>
```

#### Running on Android Emulator
Ensure you have an Android emulator created and running through Android Studio.

```bash
meteor npm run start android
```

### iOS Development (Mac Only)

#### Initial Setup
```bash
meteor add-platform ios
```

#### Running on Physical iOS Device
Connect your iOS device to your Mac. This command will open Xcode where you need to manually select your device and build.

```bash
meteor npm run start ios-device --mobile-server=https://<your-proxy-url-or-production-domain>
```

#### Running on iOS Simulator
This command opens Xcode where you can select your preferred iOS simulator.

```bash
meteor npm run start ios
```

## Production Build Process

### Creating Production Builds

Generate a production-ready Android App Bundle (AAB) for Google Play Store distribution:

```bash
meteor build output/ --architecture os.linux.x86_64 --server=https://<your-production-domain>
```

**Build output:**
- The generated `.aab` file will be located in the `output/` directory
- This file is ready for upload to Google Play Console
- No additional tunneling tools are required for production builds

## Push Notification Testing

### Sending Test Notifications

Use the provided shell script to send test push notifications. Configure the script with your server details:

```bash
PUSHGATEWAY="http://localhost:3000"
RELYINGPARTY="your-username"
```

Run the notification script:
```bash
./send-notification.sh
```

### Expected Response Examples

```json
{"success":false,"error":"The registration token is not a valid FCM registration token"}
{"success":true,"action":"approve"}
{"success":true,"action":"reject"}
{"success":true,"action":"timeout"}
```

**Response meanings:**
- `success: false` - Invalid FCM token or configuration issue
- `action: approve` - User approved the notification
- `action: reject` - User rejected the notification
- `action: timeout` - Notification timed out without user interaction
