## Push Notifications

### Sending Push Notifications to Meteor Server
To send push notifications, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the server is running locally on `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Use the following `curl` command to send a push notification:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
       "token": "<FCM_TOKEN>",
       "title": "Test Notification",
       "body": "This is a test message from Meteor.",
       "data": {"customKey": "customValue"}
   }' \
   http://localhost:3000/send-notification
   ```
   Replace `<FCM_TOKEN>` with the actual FCM token obtained during device registration.

3. The server responds with a JSON object confirming the message delivery:
   ```json
   {"success":true,"messageId":"projects/miewebauthapp/messages/0:1735348363018943%a09965e2a09965e2"}
   ```
